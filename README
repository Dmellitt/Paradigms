Programming Paradigms Final Project - David Mellitt & James Farrington
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For our final project we created a 2-player spaceship shooting game. To play the game follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have access to python2 (not python3) with the pygame and twisted libraries installed
	i.e. running 'python' on ash or on newt comes ready with these libraries

2. Player 1 should run 'python player1.py' while logged onto newt.campus.nd.edu (player2 is set to listen on newt as it was faster for our testing)

3. Player 2 should run 'python player2.py' again preferably on newt.campus.nd.edu

4. Both players can control their spaceship using the 'WASD' keys to move around and the SPACE bar to shoot.
	A and D rotate the player's ship while W and S accelerate the ship moving forwards or backwards.

5. Players can now fire missiles at each other using SPACE bar. Each time a player is hit, their spaceship shrinks in size.
	After a certain number of hits, the spaceship is exploded.
	
6. To exit simply hit the x arrow in the top right.

The game continues even after one player is eliminated as the other player is still able to fly around in celebration :).

The gameplay works by having each player send their ship's location, velocity, and lasers to the other player via TCP.
You might see some slight "rubberbanding" if one player is on a slower connection as their ship will keep getting reset
on the other player's screen. This occurs because we mimic the other player's ship's movement for each player (i.e.
we have an instance of both ships for each player and update the enemy's ship's velocity and movement accordingly).
