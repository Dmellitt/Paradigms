Update: Set up basic framework for TCP stuff but currently they are both sending data to each other but neither seems to be receivig anything :/.

The way I set it up as of now is for player1 to start the connection and player 2 joins, then the game starts.

Ill have more time to look at it tomorrow but lmk if you know why theyre not receiving any data.

Also newt is wayyyy faster than ash for testing it fyi.
